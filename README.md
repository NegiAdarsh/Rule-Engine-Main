# Rule Engine with AST

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b650b1d0-88f5-4d4c-98bb-ced66a42cf36)

This project is a **3-tier rule engine application** designed to determine user eligibility based on attributes such as **age, department, income, spend**, and more. It leverages an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** to represent conditional rules, enabling dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

## üöÄ Objective

The application evaluates complex rules dynamically based on a user's data attributes. It offers APIs for:

- Creating rules and converting them into ASTs.
- Efficiently combining multiple rules.
- Evaluating rules against user data for eligibility determination.

---

## üåü Key Features

- **AST Representation**: Uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to define and evaluate rules.
- **Dynamic Rule Creation**: Create rules from strings and convert them into AST format dynamically.
- **Efficient Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules while minimizing redundant checks.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate user attributes against rules to determine eligibility.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionalities

### For Users:
- **Create Rules**: Define conditional rules using a user-friendly UI, then convert them into ASTs.
- **Modify Rules**: Update operators, operands, or sub-expressions within the AST.
- **Evaluate Rules**: Test rules against user data (e.g., age, department, salary) for eligibility checks.
- **Combine Rules**: Merge multiple rules into a single AST using efficient strategies to reduce redundant checks.

### For Administrators:
- **Manage Rules**: Create, update, or delete rules within a centralized catalog.
- **View Rule Details**: View and validate rules in AST format for debugging.

### General Features:
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use interface for creating and managing rules.
- **API Integration**: RESTful API endpoints for rule creation, combination, and evaluation.
- **Data Persistence**: Persist rules and metadata in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for invalid rule strings or formats.
- **Validation**: Ensure attributes meet predefined criteria from the rule catalog.
